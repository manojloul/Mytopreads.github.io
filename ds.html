             <li>expounds principles of object-oriented program design, top-down refinement, review, and testing, principles that the student will see demonstrated and is expected  to follow throughout the sequel. At the same time, this project provides an opportunity for the student to review the syntax of elementary features of C++, the  programming language used throughout the book.</li>
             <li> the first data structure we study, the stack. The chapter applies stacks to the development of programs for reversing input, for modelling a desk calculator, and for checking the nesting of brackets. We begin by utilizing the STL stack implementation, and later develop and use our own stack implementation.</li>
             <li>A major goal is to bring the student to appreciate the ideas behind information hiding, encapsulation and data abstraction and to apply methods of top-down design to data as well as to algorithms. The chapter closes with an introduction to abstract data types.</li>
             <li>Queues are the central topic of Chapter 3. The chapter expounds several different implementations of the abstract data type and develops a large application program showing the relative advantages of different implementations.</li>
             <li>4 presents linked implementations of stacks and queues. The chapter Queues begins with a thorough introduction to pointers and dynamic memory management in C++. After exhibiting a simple linked stack implementation,</li>
              <li>Chapter 5 continues to elucidate stacks by studying their relationship to problem solving and programming with recursion. These ideas are reinforced by exploring several substantial applications of recursion, including backtracking and tree-structured programs.</li>
              <li>More general lists with their linked and contiguous implementations provide the theme for Chapter 6. The chapter also includes an encapsulated string implementation, an introduction to C++ templates, and an introduction to algorithm analysis in a very informal way.</li>
              <li>Chapter 7, Chapter 8, and Chapter 9 present algorithms for searching, sorting, and table access (including hashing), respectively. These chapters illustrate the Sorting interplay between algorithms and the associated abstract data types, data structures, and implementations</li>
