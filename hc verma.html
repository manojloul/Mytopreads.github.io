         <li>Physics is the study of nature and its laws. We expect that all these different events in nature take place according to some basic laws and revealing these laws of nature from the observed events is physics</li>
         <li> Physics is concerned with the basic rules which are applicable to all domains of life. Understanding of physics, therefore, leads to applications in many fields including bio and medical sciences.</li>
        <li>The great physicist Dr R. P. Feynman has given a wonderful description of what is “understanding the nature”. Suppose we do not know the rules of chess but are allowed to watch the moves of the players. If we watch the game for a long time, we may make out some of the rules. With the knowledge of these rules we may try to understand why a player played a particular move.</li>
        <li>Physics goes the same way. The nature around us is like a big chess game played by Nature. The events in the nature are like the moves of the great game.  We are allowed to watch the events of nature and guess at the basic rules according to which the events take place. We may come across new events which do not follow the rules guessed earlier and we may have to declare the old rules inapplicable or wrong and discover new rules.</li>
        <li>The description of nature becomes easy if we have the freedom to use mathematics. To say that the gravitational force between two masses is proportional to the product of the masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance apart</li>
        <li>Physics describes the laws of nature. This description is quantitative and involves measurement and comparison of physical quantities. </li>   
         <li>Mathematics is the language of physics. It becomes
            easier to describe, understand and apply the physical
            principles, if one has a good knowledge of mathematics.
            In the present course we shall constantly be using the
            techniques of algebra, trigonometry and geometry as
            well as vector algebra, differential calculus and
            integral calculus. In this chapter we shall discuss the
            latter three topics. </li>
