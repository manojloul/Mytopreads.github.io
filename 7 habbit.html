      <ul>
    <li><p> Win-Win: Both people win. Agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying to both parties.</p></li>
    <li><p> Win-Lose: "If I win, you lose." Win-Lose people are prone to use position, power, credentials, and personality to get their way.</p></li>
    <li><p> Lose-Win: "I lose, you win." Lose-Win people are quick to please and appease, and seek strength from popularity or acceptance.</p></li>  
    <li><p> Lose-Lose: Both people lose. When two Win-Lose people get together -- that is, when two, determined, stubborn, ego-invested individuals interact -- the result will be Lose-Lose.</p></li>
    <li><p> Win: People with the Win mentality don't necessarily want someone else to lose -- that's irrelevant. What matters is that they get what they want.</p></li>
    <li><p> Win-Win or No Deal: If you can't reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, there is no deal.</p></li>      
     <li><p> Sharpen the Saw:To be effective, we must devote the time to renewing ourselves physically, spiritually, mentally, and socially.</p></li>
